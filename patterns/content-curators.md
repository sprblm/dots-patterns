## The Design Problem 

In a decentralized social network, people cannot (or should not) rely on centralized algorithms to view their feed. Protocols struggle to decide between
displaying everything and allowing users to choose certain filter options, for example only displaying feeds from people the user "follows". This requires 
a lot of overhead in managing your feed.

## The Design Solution 

Media and news organizations are the curators of content.

### Examples 

- Twitter lists 
- Are.na 
- Mastodon 'Who's on this instance' 

## Why Choose Content Curators? 

More flexibility and control over feeds.  

## Best Practices: How to Implement Content Curators? 
- Only place trusted and verified third parties in the role of content curators. 
- Allow users to access more interesting and relevant contents and therefore fosters a stronger and meaningful relationship with their network.


## Potential Problems with Content Curators?
- Keep in mind that not all media and news organisations are necessarily good at curating contents. In addition, the majority of them might tend to have some certain biases and or positions. This means the quality and credibility of a content is crowdsourced and explicitly based on users' choice of curators. 
- The level of contents relevance might vary depends on different platforms.  

## The Take-Away

This is more of an opt-in option rather than a catch-all solution for curating contents.
