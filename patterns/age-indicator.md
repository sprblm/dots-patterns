## The Design Problem

In a local-first world, peers may or may not be connected to the network at all times, and information left by the users could be out-of-date. When and how is
dated information is shown on the network?

## The Design Solution

Give a visual indication for the age of a piece of information, for example when a peer was last seen. Fading a tag or a card usually works.

### Examples

## Why Choose Age Indicator?

- Age indicator shows you information about network participants without taking up too much space. 
- It comes in handy when distinguishing a viral thread in a yet-to-be federated part of the network. 

## Potential Problems with Age Indicator

- When there are multiple dimensions of aging—is it when a peer was last seen? or the last time this file was updated?—having age indicator might be confusing. Also, if your color contrast doesn’t allow for fading, age indicator is not a good choice here.
- A single visual indication is not enough to accommodate both spectrums of the 'aging' quality: Is it becoming irrelevant and out-of-date? Or has it become more valuable with the increased engagement over the course of time?
